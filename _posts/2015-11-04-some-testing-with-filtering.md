### Update

This blog is starting to come together. The layout is almost finished and its possible to 
find all blog posts under blog. Next step will be to work more with filtering and presenting 
blog posts on the index and blog page. Also the about section needs to be filled out.

At a later step disqus will be implemented with some other features.


### Test

This blog post is mostly to test the current filtering on the index page where the two latest blog posts will be
shown and that the blog section will show all but truncated text for each post.
